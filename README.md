# errors encountered:

1. need to use go env -w GO111MODULE=auto otherwise go is losing path in containers
2. better have urls within quotation marks
3. mysql default handler doesnt work due to issues with the path reading a @ randomly?!?!?!
4. need to use go version 1.14 because 1.16 cant work inside a container, so ignore number 1
